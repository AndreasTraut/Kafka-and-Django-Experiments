# "Real-Time" Internet-of-Things Project

I am working on a "Real-Time" app for streaming Internet-of-Things (IoT) data (e.g. temperature,...) through Kafka and Apache Streams into my Django app and applying machine-learning prediction algorithms. 

## Structure
Part 1:   
  Experimentations on running  Kafka Producer/Consumer in WLS Ubuntu.   
  
Part 2:   
  Experimentations on connecting Kafka with Django in VSC (using WSL Ubuntu).   
  

In this repository I am working on Part 2: "Connecting Kafka with Django in VSC (using WSL Ubuntu)" 

Part 1 see https://github.com/AndreasTraut/kafka_2.13-2.8.0
